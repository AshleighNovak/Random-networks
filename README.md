# Random-networks

Using network analysis with acoustic telemetry data can be a powerful tool to understand individual and species level connectivity across an environment.

This repository provides some simple code to generate random networks based on specificying the number of receivers in an array and the number of filtered detections for an individual animal. It's used to test if the animal's network is nonrandom. It seems intuitivative that an animal's path would always be nonrandom, but there was some pushback from the community suggesting that there should be a way to prove that. This is one solution and I am happy to talk about this concept with you further!

If you use this code, please cite accordingly.

Thanks!
